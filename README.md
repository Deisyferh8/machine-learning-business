# machine-learning-business

A small collection of Jupyter notebooks and example datasets demonstrating practical machine learning applications for business problems. The repository includes "Project 9 - Machine Learning in Business", which explores geospatial data, data cleaning, visualization, and model-building workflows using the CSV files in the `data/` folder.

How to explore:
- Open `Project 9 - Machine Learning in Business.ipynb` to run the analysis interactively.
- Sample data is available in the `data/` directory (e.g. `geo_data_0.csv`, `geo_data_1.csv`, `geo_data_2.csv`).

Feel free to add issues or pull requests with improvements, additional examples, or notes about how you used these notebooks in a business context.
